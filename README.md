# The effect of wearing mask in an indoor area simulation with NetLogo 
This project is part of my premaster program at Tilburg University and it was about simulating the effeteness of wearing a mask against COVID-19 in an indoor area.
The simulation is done using Netlogo and analyzed with R. 

The files are:
-	MAS-data_analysis.Rmd is the R-code for data analysis. It can be run in RStudio. 
-	MAS-data_analysis.html is the result of data analysis in html format
-	MAS_covid_mask_on_spread_model.nlogo is the Netlogo code. It can be run on https://www.netlogoweb.org/launch#https://www.netlogoweb.org/assets/modelslib/IABM%20Textbook/chapter%202/Simple%20Economy.nlogo
-	Data-3.csv is the output data from the NetLogo simulation.
